First, start PostgreSQL and the database created in Phase 1.

Open the solution in Visual Studio. Right click the project (Phase3Site) in the solution explorer and click "View in Browser". This will build and open the web application in a browser. That's it!

Troubleshooting:
Make sure the database is being served on the default port of localhost, and that "postgres" is the name of the database and the name of the authorized database user.
